# Don't Starve Inscryption Mod

This mod adds 64 cards to Act 1, Act 2, and Kaycee's Mod, based on the various mobs from Don't Starve, its DLC, and Don't Starve Together.

It includes cards of all 4 cost types, and at least one card with each combination of 2 costs.

Use of the Gem Deer side deck is highly recommended for the balance of the mod!

Made entirely by me, empathy.mp3 (code, art, etc.)
