# notes

-   very long delay after all the blueheart, orangeheart, and greenheart sigils for some reason but they work on both sides
-   wendy and woodie sigils work just fine
-   venom and poison also lag a fuck ton
-   Blue is utility
-   Green is vitality, health, growth, and ramping ability
-   Orange is combat, violence, military, and set power
